This flower embodies the great variety of and fascination with the orchid family. Orchids come in all shapes, sizes, colors, textures and scents—perhaps this is why they’ve entranced cultures dating back well over five millennia, becoming symbols of virility, beauty, peace and prosperity in the process. Named “Cattleya” after my first rare orchid, this work is my Ode to Orchids—a mystical flower that brings me endless delight.\n\n<b><span style='color: rgb(153,153,153); line-height: 32px;'>Background</span></b>\nThis is a \"<a href='https://tylerxhobbs.com/essays/2021/the-rise-of-long-form-generative-art' target='_blank'>long-form</a>\" generative artwork, developed in JavaScript using <a href='https://p5js.org/' target='_blank'>p5.js</a>. In other words, the artwork is an algorithm that generates a new, unique image each time it's run. The images here aren't drawings or paintings; they are imagined and virtually rendered by a complex system I designed after close study of real-life orchids. The algorithm, totalling about 30kB in size, is stored in perpetuity on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n<b><span style='color: rgb(153,153,153); line-height: 32px;'>Availability</span></b>\nA \"living instance\" of the algorithm tied to one image can be minted on <a href='https://www.artblocks.io/project/308' target='_blank'>ArtBlocks</a> or purchased on <a href='https://opensea.io/collection/cattleya-by-ben-snell' target='_blank'>secondary markets</a>. Off-chain, unsigned archival prints of some of my favorite outputs, distinct from those minted on ArtBlocks, are <a href='https://shop.bensnell.io/' target='_blank'>also available</a>.\n\n<b><span style='color: rgb(153,153,153); line-height: 32px;'>Notes</span></b>\nThe algorithm is intended to be run on modern devices and browsers (recommended: Chrome, Safari or Firefox).\n\n<b><span style='color: rgb(153,153,153); line-height: 32px;'>License</span></b>\nxxx\n\n<b><span style='color: rgb(153,153,153); line-height: 32px;'>Attribution</span></b>\n- ArtBlocks\n- p5.js\n- Matt DesLauriers' <a href='glsl-fast-gaussian-blur' target='_blank'>blur shader</a>",
