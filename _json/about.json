	"description" : "Ben Snell is an artist based in New York. His practice investigates materialities and ecologies of computation. Using contemporary techniques in dialogue with traditional motifs, he situates technology as a mirror to reveal the self as a computational being. With emphasis on inquiry and introspection, his work takes the form of drawings, photography and sculpture.\n\nHe holds a B.A. in Experiential Art and Design from Carnegie Mellon University and was recently an Artist in Residence at Pier 9 Autodesk. Earlier this year, his sculpture 'Dio' was the first AI-generated sculpture to sell at Phillips auction and was a finalist in the Lumen Prize. His work has been shown internationally and featured in Artsy, Artnet, and other major publications.",
