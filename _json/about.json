    "description" : "Ben Snell is an artist who listens to the inner dialogues of the machine. Using contemporary techniques and traditional motifs, he navigates the space between creation and automation, suggesting a humanist approach to technology. Through drawings, images and sculpture, he explores what it means to be born from code.\n\nSnellâ€™s AI sculpture was the first-of-its-kind to sell at Phillips. He was a finalist for the Lumen Prize and a resident of Autodesk Pier 9. His work is shown internationally and featured in Artsy, Artnet and other major publications. He received a BA in Experiential Art and Design from Carnegie Mellon University. He lives and works in New York.",
