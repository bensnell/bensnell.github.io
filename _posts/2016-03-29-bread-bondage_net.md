Dough Experiment 5


First, I knit a fine net from thread, from which I hung the dough. However, as the dough rose, it extruded itself from the net, creating a stratified lump of dough.

The patterns that result from this extrusion appear to be a result of alternating oiled and non-oiled surfaces. Up close, the non-oiled surfaces have dried out faster, creaintg a fine web-like texture.

The dough that remained in the net, once baked, appears like a hatched catapillar cocoon.
